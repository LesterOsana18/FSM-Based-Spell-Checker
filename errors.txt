Error 1: Repeated print statements
> Scenario:
     Input 1: quikc 
     Output: Invalid

     Input 2: Boy
     Output: Invalid, Valid

     Input 3: liek
     Output: Invalid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid

     Final Output in the Console:  Invalid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid

> Reason: 
     The FSM resets to the start state after every word, meaning, it reprocesses the words,
          thus why it reprints previous resulting states.

     There is no mechanism to skip the processed words.

> Possible Solution: 
     Find a way to track and skip processed words.
