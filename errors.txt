Error 1: Repeated print statements [SOLVED | 2024-12-25 | 6:34 AM]
> Scenario:
     Input 1: quikc 
     Output: Invalid

     Input 2: Boy
     Output: Invalid, Valid

     Input 3: liek
     Output: Invalid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid

     Final Output in the Console:  Invalid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid, Valid, Invalid

> (Possible) Reason: 
     The FSM resets to the start state after every word, meaning, it reprocesses the words,
          thus why it reprints previous resulting states.

     There is no mechanism to skip the processed words.

> Possible Solution: 
     Find a way to track and skip processed words.

Error 2: Valid words tagged as `Invalid` (Some forms of verbs or plural nouns are tagged as `Invalid`)
> Scenario: 
     Input: Jump
     Resulting State: Valid

     Input: Jumps
     Resulting State: Invalid

     Input: Jumping
     Resulting State: Invalid

     Input: Jumped
     Resulting State: Invalid

     Input: Run
     Resulting State: Valid

     Input: Running 
     Resulting State: Valid

     Input: Runs
     Resulting State: Invalid

     Input: Ran
     Resulting State: Valid

> (Possible) Reason: 
     Part of the limitations of the word list itself. (NLKT prolly doesn't cover a range of inflected words.) 

> Possible Solution:
     Not sure if we're going to encounter the same issue if we switch to Tagalog Dictionary (but most likely, if we can't find a comprehensive tagalog word list).
          Not sure din if we're going to deal with it, if ever. 
          ++ Refer to Kyrelle's comment on the scope and limitations (pg. 5, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9fxzwxTJWsBQdqf16B5bnyN89oqwDOck3RtadYaaYg/edit?tab=t.0 )

     In such case, we can find/look for a comprehensive pre-defined tagalog dictionary/word list containing
          the root words and the common conjugations or forms of the words.
