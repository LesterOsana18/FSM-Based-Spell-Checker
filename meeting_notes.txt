FILIPINO_DICT.TXT CONTENTS | January 07, 2025

--- Categories ---

1. Dictionary-Based Words

     Reference : https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aeg8731.0001.001/163?page=root&size=100&view=pdf&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2WppNb25jEygtBuPN46Ms3IflobiG98VF3ecdt9dFt4ni9hLvfV2nKhVw_aem_Aix1g4i_b0gs5oDJuWnQWQ

     Notes:
     1. This reference was chosen as it contains lesser words than the initial dictionary.
     2. We only need to use pages 7 to 149.
     2. Some words may have already been added in the filipino_dict.txt, I recommend editing directly in vs code as words in the document are suggested as you type them, indicating that they're already included.
     
     Issues/Reminders: 
     Some of the words in the given reference are not very reliable
          - some words are missing hypens
          - some words are not correctly spelled (if you base on the text guide panel seen in the link)
          - if you doubt the spelling of a certain word (e.g. "tahul" instead of "tahol"), consult google or other sources to find the most accurate spelling.
     
     Also, as you input words, it is advised to think of the other possible variations for them:
          for example:
               dictionary word: gupit
               other variations that we can also input in the filipino_dict.txt : maggupit, naggupit, naggugupit, etc.

          Guidelines:
          a. consider prefixes (ma-, na-, pa-, um-, nag-, mag-, pag-, nagpa-, etc.), suffixes (-in, -an, -han, etc.), and infixes(-in-, -um-, etc.) 
          b. consider superlatives (napaka-, pinaka-)
          c. consider root words, compound words, and plural forms (if applicable)
          d. consider linking forms (with "-ng" or "-g" at the end)
               for example:
                    balon --> balong
                    halata --> halatang
          e. consider synonyms and antonyms (if any comes to mind)

2. Places in the Philippines 
     
     Notes:
     1. Just include the names of the places individually per line, do not include english words 
          for example: instead of Davao City,
               include:
                    Lungsod             //Assumming this is not already included
                    ng                  //same here
                    Davao
     2. Reference is accessible online (google search), [pasearch nalang po thank youu]

3. Shorthened words (with apostrophes)

     Notes:
     1. Mostly pronouns with "'y" or words preceeding the the word "at" (shortened to "<word>'t")
     2. You may search for words to be included here or simply consult the words already in our file and references and transform them. 
     3. Keep in mind that some words for this are already included in our filipino_dict.txt (e.g. ako'y, sayo'y, ito'y, etc.), please double check to be safe.

4. Repeated words (Inuulit na mga salita: e.g. araw-araw)

     Notes:
     1. Usually nouns
     2. Consider still variations with suffixes (e.g. araw-arawin), prefixes (e.g. paulit-ulit), and infixes (if any)
     3. Also consider again their linking forms (e.g. araw-arawing)

5. Prepositions, Conjuctions, Interjections

     Notes:
     1. There are already many prepositions (e.g. sa, pero, etc.), and conjuctions (e.g. at, etc.), double check if there are any other prepositions and conjunctions missing.
     2. Include interjections (e.g. Aba, naku, oy, O, etc.) as there are currently not much in our file. 
     3. You may search for words to be included here as not much is covered in the reference.

6. Adjectives

     Notes:
     1. This may already be covered in the dictionary but not all of it, I believe.
     2. This reference could be of use: https://www.scribd.com/document/385777140/talaan-ng-mga-pang-uri-pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1S3pAD227eQUDvrog9xwgSsPPyhhniYO_hbKWP2kRYb8W056UaTLS7r9A_aem_-hJCo3PubF9TlTWvBH7ZeA
     3. Also searching for other references is advised. 
     4. Again, double check if the words are already in our file.
     5. Reconsider the stated guidelines in the Dictionary-based words.

7. Animals

     Notes:
     1. Some animals are already included in our file, please double check before including more.
     2. Consider male or female wording variations (e.g. manok --> inahin, tandang)

8. Food

     Notes:
     1. Some foods are already included, please double just to be safe
     2. Consider fruits, vegetables, viands, kakanin, street foods, etc.
     3. Consider ingredients (condiments or raw versions (e.g. bigas))

9. Numbering

     Notes:
     1. Basic numbering like "isa", "dalawa", ... were already covered
     2. Include numbers as time (double check as some are already included)
     3. Include also spanish numbering (e.g. uno, dos, tres, etc.), please double check as some might have already been included in our file.
     4. Consider ordinal and monetary forms 

ps. feel free to include other words not covered by any of the above categories and are not yet included in our file. ^^
